```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dfStable <- read_tsv("UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
```

This is a cross-wave data file with stable characteristics of individuals. See the codebook at https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/dataset-documentation/search/datafile/xwavedat.

Exercises.

1. Select the variables for: sex (derived), date of birth (doby_dv), ethnic group (racel_dv). Also keep the cross-wave identifier (pidp) and the sample origin variable (memorig).

    ```{r}
dfStable1 <- dfStable %>%
      select(pidp, memorig, sex_dv, doby_dv, racel_dv)
    ```

2. Filter the data to keep:
        a) men only.
        b) people born before 1950 and after 1975.
        c) men of Pakistani origin born in 1958 or 1982. 


    ```{r}
# a)
    dfStable1 %>%
      filter(sex_dv == 1)
# b)
    dfStable1 %>% count(doby_dv)
    dfStable1 %>%
      filter(doby_dv > 0) %>% 
      filter(doby_dv < 1950 | doby_dv > 1975)
# c)
    dfStable1 %>%
      filter(sex_dv == 1) %>%
      filter(racel_dv == 10) %>%
      filter(doby_dv == 1958 | doby_dv == 1982)
    
    dfStable1 %>%
      filter(sex_dv == 1 & racel_dv == 10 & (doby_dv == 1958 | doby_dv == 1982))
    ```

3. Recode birth year into cohorts (a new variable): the G.I. Generation (born before 1924), Silent Generation (1925-42), Baby Boomers (1943-65), Generation X (1966-1980), Millenials (1981-99), Generation Z (2000-). (The years are approximate.)

    ```{r}
dfStable1 <-  dfStable1 %>%
      mutate(cohort = case_when(
        doby_dv > 0 & doby_dv < 1924 ~ "G.I.Generation",
        between(doby_dv, 1925, 1942) ~ "Silent generation",
        doby_dv %in% 1943:1965 ~ "Baby boomers",
        doby_dv %in% 1966:1980 ~ "Generation X",
        doby_dv %in% 1981:1999 ~ "Millenials",
        doby_dv > 2000 ~ "Generation Z"
      ))
    
dfStable1 %>% count(cohort)

    ```

4. Recode ethnicity into the following groups: white British, Other White, Indian, Pakistani, other. (This classification doesn't make much sense, but we're doing this as an exercise).


    ```{r}
dfStable1 <- dfStable1 %>%
      mutate(ethnNew = recode(racel_dv,
        '1' = "White British",
        '2' = "other White",
        '3' = "other White",
        '4' = "other White",
        '9' = "Indian",
        '10' = "Pakistani",
        '-9' = NA_character_,
        .default = "other"
      ))
    
dfStable1 %>% count(ethnNew)
        
    ```


5. Count the number of people belonging to different ethnic groups (and produce percentages). 

    ```{r}
dfStable1 %>%
  count(ethnNew) %>%
  mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100)
    ```

6. Summarise the proportion of white British by generation.

    ```{r}
dfStable1 %>%
  filter(racel_dv != -9) %>%
  mutate(whiteBritish = ifelse(racel_dv == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(cohort) %>%
  summarise(
propWhiteBritish = mean(whiteBritish, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )
    ```
